# C-language_lab2
The repository you mentioned contains a collection of C language projects. Each project is represented by a separate file, and I will provide a brief overview of each file:

1. p10_graphics.c: This file appears to be related to graphics programming in C. Unfortunately, without more information or the actual contents of the file, it is difficult to provide a detailed description. Graphics programming typically involves creating and manipulating graphical elements such as shapes, colors, and images on a screen or canvas.

2. p1_call_by_value.c: This file likely demonstrates the concept of function parameter passing in C using call by value. Call by value means that when a function is called, the values of the arguments are copied into the function's parameters. Any changes made to the parameters within the function do not affect the original values.

3. p2_call_by_reference.c: This file likely explores the concept of function parameter passing in C using call by reference. Call by reference allows a function to modify the values of the variables passed as arguments by using pointers. Changes made to the parameters within the function will affect the original variables.

4. p3_recursion.c: This file likely involves the implementation of recursive functions. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. Recursive functions have a base case that terminates the recursion and one or more recursive calls that solve the smaller subproblems.

5. p4_extern_class.c: This file may demonstrate the usage of the `extern` keyword in C. The `extern` keyword is used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another source file. It allows multiple files to share the same variable or function.

6. p4_static_variable.c: This file may showcase the usage of static variables in C. Static variables are variables that retain their values between function calls. They are initialized only once and persist throughout the lifetime of the program.

7. p5_pointer_to_array.c: This file likely explores the concept of pointers to arrays in C. Pointers to arrays can be used to access and manipulate array elements efficiently. They can also be used to pass arrays to functions or dynamically allocate memory for arrays.

8. p6_pointer_to_function.c: This file may involve the usage of function pointers in C. Function pointers are variables that store the memory address of a function. They can be used to dynamically select and call different functions at runtime.

9. p7_pointer_to_pointer.c: This file likely demonstrates the concept of pointers to pointers in C. Pointers to pointers are variables that store the memory address of another pointer variable. They are often used in situations where multiple levels of indirection are required, such as dynamically allocating multidimensional arrays.

10. p8_Structure.c: This file may involve the usage of structures in C. Structures allow you to create user-defined data types that can hold multiple variables of different types. They are useful for organizing related data into a single unit.

11. p9_union.c: This file likely explores the concept of unions in C. Unions are similar to structures, but they can only hold one value at a time, using the same memory space for all the members. Unions are useful when you need to store different types of data in the same memory location.
